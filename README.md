### Problem
Discovering groups of interest is tedious and difficult in the modern day and age. Bombarded with too many, it can be hard to find the right group of people... especially as a college student. Fumbling with classes, homework, tests, and activities, it's not hard to imagine the difficulties that college students have when trying to get involved in new groups of interest. With over 1000+ registered student organization at UIUC alone, it's a whirlwind just trying to pick and choose which ones to attend.
### Solution
Often times students end up trying out 10-20+ clubs, only to end up becoming regulars to a select few. EZSched is designed to minimize the wasted time that's spent going to clubs that seemed to be a good fit, but in reality were not. By allowing users and organizations to input their schedules and relevant interests, we can cross-reference their schedules and suggest different club activities and events for users to attend. Effectively EZSched helps our users save valuable time by eliminating the out-dated process of manually finding, picking, and trying out groups of interest.
